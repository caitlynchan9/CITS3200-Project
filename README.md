# CITS3200-Project
Interview guide builder for UWA Talent Acquisition.

## Project Brief: 

The project would involve developing a digital solution to more easily select appropriate competencies and the relevant questions for the role and provide a nicely formatted template ready to be used. Ideally (but optionally), it would also allow users to complete the documents during interviews to create a selection report.

This project proposal will fulfill the following requirements: 

	1. Host a database of competencies and questions.
	2. Provide a tool for selected competencies and questions to merge into two separate Word documents
		a. Interview guide
		b. selection matrix. 

The above functionalities #1 and #2 would be used by a small number of users (5 or 6 HR team members who would use the system regularly). The documents generated would then be distributed to relevant users (members of interview panels. This would save a significant amount of time.
